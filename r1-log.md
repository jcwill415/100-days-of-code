UPPER

7. What will this date and modifier produce?
DATE("now", "+1 day")
Tommorrow

8. LENGTH() is described as a: Function

9. The ___ keyword is used after the ORDER BY clause to order dates from the most recent to the furthest back in time.
DESC

10. _____ BY is used to aggregate rows together.
GROUP

11. If today was the 8th July 2018, how would I write that date in SQLite/SQL Playground?

DATE() Function  
DATE("now") - get today's date w/ time string "now"
DATE("2016-12-19 09:10:55") - trim off time portion of time string
DATE("2016-12-19 09:10:55", "+1 year") - w/ modifier to calculate dates too

TIME() Function
TIME("now") - get time "now"
TIME("2016-12-19 09:10:55") - remove date from time string
TIME("2016-12-19 09:10:55", "+1 hour") - w/ modifier to create new date strings

STRFTIME() Function
Format with values substituted by parts of the date passed in the second argument of the STRFTIME Function

STRFTIME("%d-%-m", "now")
STRFTIME("%m-%-Y", "2016-12-19 09:10:55")
STRFTIME("%Y", "2016-12-19 09:10:55", "+1 year")

### R1D11 06/26/19 - part 1
In a movies database we have a movies table. It has the columns of id, title, date_released and genre.

Write a query that returns the title first and the month and year it was released alias as month_year_released. Dates should look like "04/1983" for April 1983.

SELECT title, STRFTIME("%m/%Y", date_released) AS month_year_released FROM movies;

STRFTIME()
STRFTIME(<format string>, <time string>, <modifier>)
            -> "01/04/2015"
STRFTIME(<format string>, "2015-04-01 23:12:01", <modifier>)

STRFTIME("%d%m$Y", "2015-04-01 23:12:01", <modifier>)
            -> "01/04/2015"

SELECT *, ordered_on AS UK_date FROM orders;
SELECT *, STRFTIME("%d%m%Y", ordered_on) AS UK_date FROM orders;

Formatting Dates For Reporting
The dates stored in a database often don't suit a human reader.

### R1D12 06/27/19
Downloaded anaconda for Python 3.7 & Jupyter Notebooks. Very excited. Also checking out the GitHub Guides! #HelloWorld

Completed Reporting w/ SQL: SQL can be used to generate reports and present information on websites.

Finishing Querying Relational Databases - 98 minutes left.

Inner Joins
Inner Joins are the most common types of Joins. Inner joins match records together where values are equal on both sides of the join statement.

-- SELECT <columns> FROM <table1> INNER JOIN <table2> ON <equality criteria> WHERE <search criteria> ...

-- What are all Chevy models?

SELECT * FROM make INNER JOIN model ON make.MakeID = model.MakeID;

SELECT MakeName, ModelName FROM make
  INNER JOIN model ON make.MakeID = model.MakeID;
  
SELECT MakeName, ModelName FROM make AS mk
  INNER JOIN model AS md ON mk.MakeID = md.MakeID;
